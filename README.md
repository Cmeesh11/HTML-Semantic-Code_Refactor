## General info

This project was to satisfy the feature requests of the following:
- Adding semantic HTML
- Fixing the structure of the HTML
- Adding alt attributes to the images
- Making sure the header attributes fall in sequential order
- Adding a concise, descriptive title

## Usage

There are no real usages of this project, as it is simply a mock website. However, changes can be viewed by looking at the comments that I've written in both the HTML and CSS files.

## Features

There are three reference links in the navbar at the top of the webpage. I have fixed them so that all three are functional.
